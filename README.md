## Sriya Reddy 

In this assignment, we are required to create a description file for our own package that we will be creating in R. 
The fields that are required for a package description are: 

1) Package name 
2) Title
3) Version
4) Authors
5) Description
6) Depends
7) License
8) LazyData

To this end, I put in all this information in the document in the repository. 
The information I put in for the package is as follows. 

```
